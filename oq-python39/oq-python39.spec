# Restore pyc to TIMESTAMP invalidation mode as default in rpmbuild
#
# Since Fedora 31, the $SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH is set in rpmbuild to the latest

# performance decrease. To avoid that, we don't default to CHECKED_HASH
# when $RPM_BUILD_ROOT is set (i.e. when we are building RPM packages).

# See https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/redhat-rpm-config/pull-request/57#comment-27426

# Support OpenSSL FIPS mode
# - In FIPS mode, OpenSSL wrappers are always used in hashlib

#   "usedforsecurity=False"
# - OpenSSL wrappers for the hashes blake2{b512,s256},
# - In FIPS mode, the blake2 hashes use OpenSSL wrappers
#   and do not offer extended functionality (keys, tree hashing, custom digest size)
# - In FIPS mode, hmac.HMAC can only be instantiated with an OpenSSL wrapper
#   or an string with OpenSSL hash name as the "digestmod" argument.
#   The argument must be specified (instead of defaulting to ‘md5’).
#
# - Also while in FIPS mode, we utilize OpenSSL's DRBG and disable the
#   os.getrandom() function.

# Original names for architectures with different names downstream
#
# https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/Python_Upstream_Architecture_Names
#
# Pythons in RHEL/Fedora used different names for some architectures
# than upstream and other distros (for example ppc64 vs. powerpc64).
# This was patched in patch 274, now it is sedded if %%with legacy_archnames.
#
# That meant that an extension built with the default upstream settings
# (on other distro or as an manylinux wheel) could not been found by Python
# on RHEL/Fedora because it had a different suffix.
# This patch adds the legacy names to importlib so Python is able
# to import extensions with a legacy architecture name in its
# file name.
# It work both ways, so it support both %%with and %%without legacy_archnames.
#
# WARNING: This patch has no effect on Python built with bootstrap
# enabled because Python/importlib_external.h is not regenerated
# and therefore Python during bootstrap contains importlib from
# upstream without this feature. It's possible to include
# Python/importlib_external.h to this patch but it'd make rebasing
# a nightmare because it's basically a binary file.
